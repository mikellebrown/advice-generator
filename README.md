## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This was a great exercise fetching resources from [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and dynamically rendering data. 
During the build I ran into an error because of an unresolved Javascript promise. 
While debugging I realized that I was requesting the wrong url ü´¢

Easy Fix! üëçüèº


### Continued development

- Build apps that communicate with API's, and implement increasingly challenging/cool features.
- CodeWars.com for JavaScript function writing practice! 
- Gain a deeper understanding of Redux and other global state managers.
